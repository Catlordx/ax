## AX

This is a simple tool to minimize the number of times you have to switch between IDE and browser

### Quick Start

You can get your API key
in [Aliyun](https://www.aliyun.com/product/bailian?spm=5176.20960838.J_4VYgf18xNlTAyFFbOuOQe.1.5dcf2868L019Av&scm=20140722.M_10447952.P_168.MO_1774-ID_10447952-MID_10447952-CID_31226-ST_10650-PA_se@1016670337-V_1)
and then open your CMD to execute following command

```
setx DASHSCOPE_API_KEY <your_api_key>
```

#### Windows

add the file path of `ax.exe` to your system's environmental variables `Path`

To affect only the current user, you can find the variable named Path in the User Variables area and select Edit. If you
want it to take effect for all users, find and edit Path in the System Variables area.

> The path is a directory path where ax.exe is located,like `C:\Users\Shelly\Desktop\ax\target\release`
